      <description>WELCOME TO THE YCAS RADIO OBSERVATORY OUR 3 METER RADIO TELESCOPE IS OPERATIONAL
FIRST LIGHT: in the early morning hours on October 31st 2024 we achieved first light. Observing in the spectral mode we captured some very nice concentrated areas of neutral hydrogen in the region of Orion. The three peaks you see in this spectrograph are three arms of our Milky Way galaxy! OPERATIONAL BUT NOT COMPLETE: although operational there&amp;rsquo;s still much work to be done to complete the project from mechanical and software upgrades to final touches in the control room.</description>

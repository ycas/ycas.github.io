### StarWatch
Learn how to find the planets and constellations that are visible in York's night sky. Become a star watcher by exploring the current night sky, locate visible planets and constellations, and enjoy some sky lore. Receive a star map and get answers to questions such as:<br>
* What can be seen with a telescope tonight?<br>
* How do I find the North Star?<br>
* Is there really a bear in the sky?<br>
* Why do stars have different colors?<br>
* What are the names of the brightest stars?<br>
* Why does Jupiter have different colored clouds?<br>

### One World, One Sky
Elmo and Big Bird live in the United States and Hu Hu Zhu lives far away in China, but they discovered that they still see the same stars at night! The word for star in Chinese is "xing xing" (pronounced sing sing). How many "xing xing" do you see in this sky?
When Elmo and Hu Hu Zhu "travel" to the moon, they discover some basic but surprising scientific facts. For example, they can't fly a kite there because there is no wind. The fuzzy friends then excitedly realize that children like to fly kites in both China and the United States!

### Flight Adventures
In Flight Adventures, dreams of flying, model aircraft and a young girl and her grandfather come together in this multimedia planetarium show about the science of aeronautics. Learn about famous inventors and aviators of the past and the pioneers who first revealed the 4 forces of flight. See images of aircraft past, present and future and imagine where flight might take us. Presented in high-definition full-dome digital video, "Flight Adventures" is unlike anything you've ever encountered.

The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) needs to clear out space in our Observatory Deck to install our new roof. We have these Telescopes and Tripods for sale. All equipment is sold "As is" with most requiring cleaning and/or may be missing some parts.

Price: Suggested Price listed but after inspecting the items, make us a reasonable offer.

When: Before our next Public Star Watch January 14, 2023, we will have the observatory at John Rudy Park open so you can inspect any items you wish to look at and make your offer. We will have all items available starting at 6:15pm on January 14th. If you cannot make the event on the 14th you may be able to make other arrangements to visit by contacting us at info@astroyork.com.

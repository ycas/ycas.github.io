## Two Public Starwatch Events 

The York County Astronomical Society* (YCAS) is pleased to partner with the Sunset Scramblers for its September 8, 2018 public starwatch being held at Stump Park, 525 Days Mill Road, York, 17408 directly beside Brillhart Station along the York County Heritage Rail Trail beginning at 8:00PM. Attendees are invited to bring their telescopes and/or binoculars and join the members of YCAS in observing the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, as well as a host of other celestial objects. For those who prefer to observe at the YCAS Observatory, YCAS members will be on hand to conduct public observing at the John C. Rudy County Park location at 8:00PM.

The Sunset Scramblers host moonlight bike rides throughout the summer and have once again asked YCAS to join them at the Heritage Rail Trail to do a starwatch following their final bike ride of the season. This is a fun, family-friendly event that all are invited to attend.

The Rudy County Park Observatory evening will begin with a screened astronomical presentation on the current night sky and a variety of astronomical topics.  Guests will then be guided on a tour of the September sky through one of the club�s telescopes.  Attendees will experience the �train of planets� as Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars will all be visible in the evening sky!

While this event is free and open to the public, your generous donation will help us to continue to bring astronomical events to the York County and surrounding areas. 

If it is clear, all activities will occur as scheduled. If it is completely cloudy or raining, the indoor activity of a screened astronomical presentation will occur as scheduled.

When arriving at the John C. Rudy County Park, please use the main park entrance, not the Administrative Office entrance. Follow the signs and lights to the event.

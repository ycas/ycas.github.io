The York County Astronomical Society* (YCAS) is pleased to present the transit of Mercury November 11, 2019, beginning at 7:30AM and going until 1:00PM at John C. Rudy County Park Observatory. 

About 13 times a century, Mercury passes between the Sun and Earth and is visible as a shadow crossing the disk of the Sun. Eye protection is required to view this event. Join us at the observatory to safely see the silhouette of Mercury.

This is the last transit of Mercury visible from Pennsylvania until May 8, 2049.

Light refreshments will be available. The program is free and open to the public, your generous donation will help us to continue to bring astronomical events to the York County and surrounding areas. 

More information on this and other programs is available from York County Department of Parks and Recreation at (717) 840-7440 or [www.yorkcountyparks.org](https://www.yorkcountyparks.org).

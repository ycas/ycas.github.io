WELCOME TO THE YCAS RADIO OBSERVATORY
OUR 3 METER RADIO TELESCOPE IS OPERATIONAL

FIRST LIGHT: in the early morning hours on October 31st 2024 we achieved first light. Observing in the spectral mode we captured some very nice concentrated areas of neutral hydrogen in the region of Orion. The three peaks you see in this spectrograph are three arms of our Milky Way galaxy!

OPERATIONAL BUT NOT COMPLETE: although operational there's still much work to be done to complete the project from mechanical and software upgrades to final touches in the control room. Since that historic first light many celestial radio sources have been detected and documented. For more than a year the radio telescope has been operating without any major issues and has been showcased for many public star watches. If all goes to plan a dedication of the radio telescope will be scheduled some time late summer 2026.

A SIX YEAR PROJECT: it has been a six year project in the making collaborating with with the York County Parks, York College of Pennsylvania and the York County Astronomical Society (YCAS). The radio telescope is totally automated, fully steerable, tracking and web accessible instrument. It will have the capability to observe any celestial object within its specification and geographical location.

EXAMPLES OF OBSERVABLE OBJECTS: include the Sun, Moon, our Milky Way galaxy and several strong radio sources including pulsars. The receiving equipment is designed to perform both continuum and spectral observations of hydrogen and reside in an environmentally stabilized and electromagnetically shielded control room with computer equipment and weather station.

A GREAT OPPORTUNITY: to explore the mysteries of the universe and learn about this unique science of astronomy. The YCAS Radio Observatory not only consist of the 3 meter radio telescope but also is equipped with radio equipment to perform other radio sciences such as VLF solar flare and VHF meteor detection.

WE ARE STILL IN NEED OF FUNDING: on going cost continue for this project. If you would like to financially support us, please earmark your contributions to the "YCAS Radio Telescope Project." We are a non-profit organization and your contribution is tax deductible.

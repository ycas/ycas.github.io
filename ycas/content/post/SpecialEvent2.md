COMING THIS SUMMER TO THE YCAS OBSERVATORY A 4.5 METER RADIO TELESCOPE

This year is going to be exciting for YCAS as we unveil our 4.5 meter radio telescope. It has been a four year project in the making collaborating with with the York County Parks, York College of Pennsylvania and the York County Astronomical Society (YCAS). 

The radio telescope will be totally automated, fully steerable, tracking and web accessible instrument. It will have the capability to observe any celestial object within its specification and geographical location. 

Examples of observable objects will include the Sun, Moon, our Milky Way galaxy and several strong radio sources including pulsars. The receiving equipment is designed to perform both continuum and spectral observations of hydrogen and will reside in an environmentally stabilized and electromagnetically shielded control room with computer equipment and weather station. 

This will be a great opportunity to explore the mysteries of the universe and learn about this unique science of astronomy. 

We are still in need of funding for this project. If you would like to financially support us, please earmark your contributions to the "YCAS Radio Telescope Project."  We are a non-profit organization and your contribution is tax deductible.

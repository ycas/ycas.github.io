The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is NASA's newest space-based telescope designed to discover new extrasolar planets.  Following in the footsteps of the Kepler mission, TESS is discovering exoplanets orbiting the closest stars to our solar system.  TESS launched in April of 2018 and is currently about halfway through its two-year prime mission.  In this presentation, Dr. Scott Fleming from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD will share the latest news from the spacecraft, including a description of how the telescope operates, and some of the latest scientific discoveries to come from the mission.

The event is April 6, 2019 at 5:30pm and is free to the all. Limited seating available on a first come, first served basis.

In **One World, One Sky: Big Bird's Adventure!**, Elmo and Big Bird live in the United States and Hu Hu Zhu lives far away in China, but they discovered that they still see the same stars at night! The word for star in Chinese is "xing xing" (pronounced "sing sing"). How many "xing xing" do you see in this sky? When Elmo and Hu Hu Zhu "travel" to the moon, they discover some basic but surprising scientific facts. For example, they can't fly a kite there because there is no wind. The fuzzy friends then excitedly realize that children like to fly kites in both China and the United States!

In **Max Goes to the Moon** children's planetarium program, Max (the dog) and a young girl named Tori take the first trip to the Moon since the Apollo era. Along the way, the story sets the stage for the topics including "Phases of the Moon," "Wings in Space?", and "Frisbees and Curve Balls on the Moon" - all thoughtfully explained so that grownups and children can learn together about science. Toward the end, Max and Tori's trip proves so inspiring to people back on Earth that all the nations of the world come together to build a great Moon colony from which "the beautiful views of Earth from the Moon made everyone realize that we all share a small and precious planet."

Relive the excitement of the early days of space exploration! From the launch of the first artificial satellite Sputnik, to the magnificent lunar landings and privately operated space flights. Be immersed and overwhelmed with this most accurate historic reconstruction of Man's first steps into space.
Who were these Men and Women that took part in these death defying endeavors? Witness their drive, their passion, and their perseverance to explore, in **DAWN OF THE SPACE AGE**.

A look at the **Apollo 11** mission to land on the moon led by commander Neil Armstrong and pilots Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. The film is a 93 minute documentary.

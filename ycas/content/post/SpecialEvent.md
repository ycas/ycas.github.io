The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will be offering a public Solar Eclipse Watch at their Observatory at John Rudy Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Monday, April 8, 2-4:30 p.m.<br><br>

Safe methods of viewing the partial solar eclipse will be made available along with explanations of what is being viewed by experienced YCAS members.

The event is free and open to the public, although your generous donation will help us to continue to bring astronomical events to the York County area.

The event will be held as long as the skies are sufficiently clear to view the sun.

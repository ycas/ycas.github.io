## Radio Astronomy, Solar Observing and Weather, and Telescope Clinic at Astronomical Society

The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will be offering a public event at their Observatory at John Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, June 15th, 2023, Solar and Radio Astronomy with Telescope Clinic from 1:00PM - 3:00PM, and "What to look for in your first telescope" presentation from 1:00PM - 2:00PM.

Society member Kerry Smith will be presenting the radio astronomy portion of the event as well as giving attendees a peek into the future of the Society's radio astronomy endeavors. Radio astronomy is the study of the unseen radiated energy in the electromagenetic spectrum below visible light. By using radio astronomy, we are able to study astronomical phenomena that are otherwise invisible.

Do you have questions about how to use your telescope? We can help. Bring your telescope to us anytime during this event.

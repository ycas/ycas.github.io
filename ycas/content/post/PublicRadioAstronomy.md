## Radio Astronomy, Solar Observing and Weather, and Telescope Clinic at Astronomical Society

The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will be offering a public event at their Observatory at John C. Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, August 25th, 2018, Solar and Radio Astronomy from 11:00AM - 3:00PM, and Telescope Clinic from 1:00PM - 2:00PM.

Society member Kerry Smith will be presenting the radio astronomy portion of the event as well as giving attendees a peek into the future of the Society's radio astronomy endeavors. Radio astronomy is the study of the unseen radiated energy in the electromagenetic spectrum below visible light. By using radio astronomy, we are able to study astronomical phenomena that are otherwise invisible.

Attendees will also be able to view the Sun through the Society's solar telescope, as well as view it remotely on a TV screen that will be hooked up to a telescope. Society member Bill Price will be presenting this portion of the day's events.

Meteorologist Drew Anderson presents at noon why we have weather on Earth (because of the sun), but did you know that the sun causes weather in space? That space weather can even affect your everyday life. The next time your GPS malfunctions or you have a power outage could it be because of something out of this world? We'll talk about it in this entertaining and energetic presentation. We'll also find out what causes the Northern Lights and why we can sometimes see them in PA. You'll hear why NASA sent up a lot of new technology to monitor space weather over the past few years, and you'll leave the talk understanding how the inside of the sun works.

Are you planning to buy an astronomical telescope for you or your family? There are many pitfalls in buying a new telescope and much to consider before you spend your money. To help get you started properly,
the York County Astronomical Society is offering **How to Buy an Astronomical Telescope** to provide information and advice regarding how to buy your first optical astronomical telescope. This presentation will being at 1:00PM sharp.

If it is clear, all activities will occur as scheduled. If it is completely cloudy or raining, the indoor activity of a screen astronomical presentation will ocurr as scheduled. In the event of extreme weather, please call 717-759-YCAS (9227). For notice of cancellation, visit [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/astroyork)

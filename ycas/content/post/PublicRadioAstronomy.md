## Radio Astronomy and Solar Observing at Astronomical Society

The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will be offering an event at their Observatory at John Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, August 30th, 2025. Solar and Radio Astronomy from noon - 3:00PM.

Society member Kerry Smith will be presenting the radio astronomy portion of the event as well as giving attendees a peek into the future of the Society's radio astronomy endeavors. Radio astronomy is the study of the unseen radiated energy in the electromagenetic spectrum below visible light. By using radio astronomy, we are able to study astronomical phenomena that are otherwise invisible.

Attendees will also be able to view the Sun through the Society's solar telescope, as well as view it remotely on a TV screen that will be hooked up to a telescope.

Do you have a telescope and have questions about using it? Send us an email at info@astroyork.com to schedule our members help at the event.

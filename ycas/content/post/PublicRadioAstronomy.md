## Radio Astronomy, Solar Observing and Weather, and Telescope Clinic at Astronomical Society

The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will be offering a public event at their Observatory at John C. Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, September 28th, 2019, Solar and Radio Astronomy from 11:00AM - 3:00PM, and Telescope Clinic from 1:30PM - 2:00PM.

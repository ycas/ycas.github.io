The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will host a Public Starwatch event at their Observatory at John C. Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, February 11th 2023, at 7:00PM to 9:00PM to view the night sky through our telescopes.

Expand your mind by taking in the expanse of the universe. Come view the February skies with us through one of our telescopes. Let our experienced members guide you on a tour of celestial wonders, including stars, planets, nebulae and the Moon. We also invited you to bring your own telescope and share your experiences with other amateur astronomers. Star charts are available to help your exploration of the nighttime sky as members laser point the night sky. 

While this event is free and open to the public, your generous donation will help us continue to bring astronomical events to the York County and surrounding areas.

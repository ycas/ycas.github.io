The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will host a Public Starwatch event at their Observatory at John C. Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, November 9th 2019, at 7:00PM to 9:00PM to view the night sky through our telescopes.

Expand your mind by taking in the expanse of the universe. Come listen to a screen astronomical presentation on the current night sky, the Mercury Transit of the Sun, and a variety of astronomical topics, then view the November skies with us through one of our telescopes. Let our experienced members guide you on a tour of celestial wonders, including stars, planets, nebulae and the Moon. We also invited you to bring your own telescope and share your experiences with other amateur astronomers. Star charts are available to help your exploration of the nighttime sky as members laser point the night sky.  

While this event is free and open to the public, your generous donation will help us continue to bring astronomical events to the York County and surrounding areas.

If it is clear, all activities will occur as scheduled. If it is completely cloudy or raining, the indoor activity of a screened astronomical presentation will occur as scheduled.

When arriving at the John C. Rudy County Park, please use the main park entrance, not the Administrative Office entrance. Follow the signs and lights to the event. The [Directions](https://www.astroyork.com/directions) page provides more details.

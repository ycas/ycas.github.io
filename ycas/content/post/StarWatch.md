The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will host a Public Starwatch event for Astronomy Day at their Observatory at John C. Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, April 13th 2019, beginning at 1:00PM to 4:00PM, then returning 8:00PM to 10:00PM to view the night sky through our telescopes.

The afternoon will begin with a screened astronomical presentation on current events, solar observing, how to use a telescope, the lives of Black Holes and in the evening April night sky. Guests will then be guided on a tour of the sky through one of the club telescopes. Attendees will be shown a host of celestial objects to include the crescent moon, globular clusters, the Orion nebula and much more. Hot beverages and light refreshments are available.

Mention astronomy, and invariably most everyone thinks of a nighttime activity observing stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae, comets or the Moon.  But, how about the Sun? Solar observation offers a unique perspective on the constant dynamic changes occurring on our closest star.  Solar telescopes enable astronomers to peer into some of the most fascinating and dramatic features. Learn about solar basics, equipment, and web-based resources where one can access near real-time solar images provided by earth-based observatories around the world and from orbiting spacecraft. Join Bill as he escorts you into the The Solar Experience.

While this event is free and open to the public, your generous donation will help us continue to bring astronomical events to the York County and surrounding areas.

If it is clear, all activities will occur as scheduled. If it is completely cloudy or raining, the indoor activity of a screened astronomical presentation will occur as scheduled.

When arriving at the John C. Rudy County Park, please use the main park entrance, not the Administrative Office entrance. Follow the signs and lights to the event. The [Directions](https://www.astroyork.com/directions) page provides more details.

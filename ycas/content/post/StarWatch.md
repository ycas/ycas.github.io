The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will host a Public Starwatch event at their Observatory at John C. Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, July 9th 2022, at 8:00PM to 10:00PM to view the night sky through our telescopes.

Expand your mind by taking in the expanse of the universe. Come view the July skies with us through one of our telescopes. Let our experienced members guide you on a tour of celestial wonders, including stars, planets, nebulae and the Moon. We also invited you to bring your own telescope and share your experiences with other amateur astronomers. Star charts are available to help your exploration of the nighttime sky as members laser point the night sky. 

A Behind the Scenes look at the Hubble Space Telescope Operations presentation by member Mike Wenz will discuss how many people have seen the wonderful pictures that the Hubble Space Telescope has produced over the 32 years of it's operation so far. However, few people have seen what is truly involved in the day to day operation of a telescope that has been called a National Treasure. This talk will take a look behind the scenes and explain how the telescope is operated and what it takes to make the science observations that lead to all of the discoveries Hubble has been involved in.

While this event is free and open to the public, your generous donation will help us continue to bring astronomical events to the York County and surrounding areas.

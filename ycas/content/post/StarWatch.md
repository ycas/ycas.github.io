The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will host a Public Starwatch event at their Observatory at John C. Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, January 12th 2019, beginning at 7:00PM.

The evening will begin with a screened astronomical presentation on current events and the January night sky. Guests will then be guided on a tour of the sky through one of the club telescopes. Attendees will be shown a host of celestial objects to include the crescent moon, globular clusters, the Andromeda galaxy and much more. Hot beverages and light refreshments are available.

While this event is free and open to the public, your generous donation will help us continue to bring astronomical events to the York County and surrounding areas.

If it is clear, all activities will occur as scheduled. If it is completely cloudy or raining, the indoor activity of a screened astronomical presentation will occur as scheduled.

When arriving at the John C. Rudy County Park, please use the main park entrance, not the Administrative Office entrance. Follow the signs and lights to the event. The [Directions](https://www.astroyork.com/directions) page provides more details.

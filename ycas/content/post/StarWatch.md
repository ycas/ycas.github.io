The York County Astronomical Society (YCAS) will host a Public Starwatch event at their Observatory at John C. Rudy County Park, 400 Mundis Race Road, York, on Saturday, October 9th 2021, at 8:00PM to 10:00PM to view the night sky through our telescopes.

Expand your mind by taking in the expanse of the universe. Come listen to a screen astronomical presentation on the current night sky, and a variety of astronomical topics, then view the October skies with us through one of our telescopes. Let our experienced members guide you on a tour of celestial wonders, including stars, planets, nebulae and the Moon. We also invited you to bring your own telescope and share your experiences with other amateur astronomers. Star charts are available to help your exploration of the nighttime sky as members laser point the night sky. 

While this event is free and open to the public, your generous donation will help us continue to bring astronomical events to the York County and surrounding areas.

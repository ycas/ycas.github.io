### StarWatch
Become a star watcher by exploring the current night sky, locate visible planets and constellations, and enjoy some sky lore. Receive a star map and get a tour of tonight's sky.

### One World, One Sky: Big Bird's Adventure!
In *One World, One Sky: Big Bird's Adventure!*, Elmo and Big Bird live in the United States and Hu Hu Zhu lives far away in China, but they discovered that they still see the same stars at night! The word for star in Chinese is "xing xing" (pronounced "sing sing"). How many "xing xing" do you see in this sky? When Elmo and Hu Hu Zhu "travel" to the moon, they discover some basic but surprising scientific facts. For example, they can't fly a kite there because there is no wind. The fuzzy friends then excitedly realize that children like to fly kites in both China and the United States!

### Defying Gravity: It IS Rocket Science!
Meet Apollo Aurora, host of the Planetarium Channel's universally loved gravity news source, *Defying Gravity, It is Rocket Science!* With special robot correspondents Apple 1-6-8-6 and EGR-1, Apollo and her team will explore rocket power, gravity on other planets, monstrous black holes, and even what keeps us grounded on Earth! Tune into this brand new planetarium show and uncover the mysteries of gravity.

### From Earth to the Universe
The night sky, both beautiful and mysterious, has been the subject of campfire stories, andcient myths, and awe for as long as there have been people. A desire to comprehend the Universe may well be humanity's oldest shared intellectual experience. Yet only recently have we truly begun to grasp our place in the vast cosmos. To learn about this journey of celestial discovery, from the theories of ancient Greek astronomers to today's grandest telescopes, we invite you to experience **From Earth to the Universe**

For thousands of years, mankind thought that the Earth was the center of the Universe. Thanks to our curiosity, imagination, and urge to explore, we now know that planets like our Earth are nothing special in the cosmos. The Sun is just one ordinary star among hundreds of billions in our galaxy, the Milky Way. With the world’s most powerful telescopes, we are able to explore more and more of the Universe. What we have found so far has surpassed even the wildest expectations of scientists as well as authors of science fiction. Most stars have planets — it turns out they are more common than we thought. A huge diversity of different worlds is out there, just waiting to be discovered.

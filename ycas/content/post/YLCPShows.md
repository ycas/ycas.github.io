### StarWatch
Learn how to find the planets and constellations that are visible in York's night sky. Become a star watcher by exploring the current night sky, locate visible planets and constellations, and enjoy some sky lore. Receive a star map and get answers to questions such as:<br>
* What can be seen with a telescope tonight?<br>
* How do I find the North Star?<br>
* Is there really a bear in the sky?<br>
* Why do stars have different colors?<br>
* What are the names of the brightest stars?<br>
* Why does Jupiter have different colored clouds?<br>

### A Part Of The Sky Called Orion
A fantastic sky lore program covering the Greek, Egyptian, and Inupiaq cultures. We learn how each of these rich cultures viewed the same stars, but had different stories and images. Told in first-person in the context of the teller's life, we experience their ancient star lore and imagery. This show is best for 2nd grade and above, but even younger ones will enjoy the storytelling imagery and theme. This is storytelling at its best. A wonderful blend of imagery, music, and word; it's a treat for all.

### Skywatchers Of Africa
For thousands of years, Africans have used their knowledge of the sky to build their societies, shape their spiritual lives, and meet their physical needs for survival.
Skywatchers of Africa highlights the diversity of African astronomy, examines cultural uses of the sky that developed throughout history, and celebrates our shared human experience.

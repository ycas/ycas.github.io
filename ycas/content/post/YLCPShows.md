### Chasing the Ghost Particle: From the South Pole to the Edge of the Universe
Deep in the ice at the heart of Antarctica, the biggest and strangest detector in the world waits for mysterious messengers from the cosmos. The detector is Ice Cube! The messengers are neutrinos, ghostly particles that give us tantalizing looks into world of exploding stars and black holes.
This show tells the incredible story of how an international team of scientists and engineers transformed one billion tons of Antarctic ice into a telescope. Building Ice Cube was a titanic endeavor driven by our human passion for discovery.
Witness stunning views of the South Pole, captivating animations of the Ice Cube detectors capturing a neutrino collision-and eye-catching views of the cosmos. Chasing the Ghost Particle: From the South Pole to the Edge of the Universe will take you on a journey you will never forget.

### Cosmic Castaways
When you look into the sky, the background not-quite-blackness is filled with the diffuse light of stars lost in the space between galaxies, these are the Cosmic Castaways.
When galaxies pass in the night they gravitationally twist and turn one another. Sometimes the interactions are nothing more than a cosmic side-swipe; two galaxies cross and both come out a little bit damaged. Sometimes the interactions merge and where once two shiny galaxies orbited now only once bursts with the light of a billion stars. No matter what happens, these events leave stellar orphans.
As the galaxies tear into one another, stars get gravitationally trapped in a tug-a-war between the two systems. Eventually, both galaxies will give up their pulling and let the stars drop. These stars are left abandoned in the space between the galaxies and scattered around the newly formed systems.

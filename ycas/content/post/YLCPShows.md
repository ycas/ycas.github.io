### StarWatch
Learn how to find the planets and constellations that are visible in York's night sky. Become a star watcher by exploring the current night sky, locate visible planets and constellations, and enjoy some sky lore. Receive a star map and get answers to questions such as:<br>
* What can be seen with a telescope tonight?<br>
* How do I find the North Star?<br>
* Is there really a bear in the sky?<br>
* Why do stars have different colors?<br>
* What are the names of the brightest stars?<br>
* Why does Jupiter have different colored clouds?<br>

### Forward! To The Moon
NASA's 21st century Artemis program, named after the Greek moon Goddess and twin of Apollo, is the next step in our mission to explore the universe and land the first woman and person of color on the surface of the Moon.

### Two Small Pieces of Glass
While attending a local star party, two teenage students learn how the telescope has helped us understand our place in space and how telescopes continue to expand our understanding of the Universe.

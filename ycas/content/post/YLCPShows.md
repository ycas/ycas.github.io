### StarWatch
Learn how to find the planets and constellations that are visible in York's night sky. Become a star watcher by exploring the current night sky, locate visible planets and constellations, and enjoy some sky lore. Receive a star map and get answers to questions such as:<br>
* What can be seen with a telescope tonight?<br>
* How do I find the North Star?<br>
* Is there really a bear in the sky?<br>
* Why do stars have different colors?<br>
* What are the names of the brightest stars?<br>
* Why does Jupiter have different colored clouds?<br>

### A Part of the Sky Called Orion
A fantastic sky lore program covering the Greek, Egyptian, and Inupiaq cultures. We learn how each of these rich cultures viewed the same stars, but had different stories and images. Told in first-person in the context of the teller's life, we experience their ancient star lore and imagery. This show is best for 2nd grade and above, but even younger ones will enjoy the storytelling imagery and theme. This is storytelling at its best. A wonderful blend of imagery, music, and word; it's a treat for all.

### Distant Worlds: Alien Life
Do you ever wonder if extraterrestrial life actually exists? Come enjoy a fulldome viewing of Distant Worlds - Alien Life. Not only does the film investigate the conditions required for life, beginning with the planets and moons in our Solar System, but it also ventures out to some of the newly-discovered exoplanets orbiting other stars. Potentially habitable exoplanets are being discovered regularly - worlds that are not only very far away, but also strange and unfamiliar. What could life on these worlds look like? What are the chances of encountering intelligent life in the future, and how might we detect it? Don't miss this unique opportunity to surpass the confines of Earth and delve into unfathomable cosmic spaces, all from the comfort of our planetarium.

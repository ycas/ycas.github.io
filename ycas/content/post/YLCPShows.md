### StarWatch
Become a star watcher by exploring the current night sky, locate visible planets, comet 46P/Wirtanen and constellations, and enjoy some sky lore. Receive a star map and get a tour of tonight's sky. The comet will be visible for a few days near December 13th.

### One World, One Sky: Big Bird's Adventure!
In *One World, One Sky: Big Bird's Adventure!*, Elmo and Big Bird live in the United States and Hu Hu Zhu lives far away in China, but they discovered that they still see the same stars at night! The word for star in Chinese is "xing xing" (pronounced "sing sing"). How many "xing xing" do you see in this sky? When Elmo and Hu Hu Zhu "travel" to the moon, they discover some basic but surprising scientific facts. For example, they can't fly a kite there because there is no wind. The fuzzy friends then excitedly realize that children like to fly kites in both China and the United States!

### Season of Light
Season of Light explores the reasons humans are so facinated with lighting up our lives during the December holiday season. It's an exploration of the astronomical meanings behind seasonal traditions, including the "Star of Bethlehem".

This presentation traces the history and development of many of the world's most endearing holiday customs, all of which involve lighting up the winter season - from the burning Yule log, sparkling Christmas tree lights and candles in windows, to the lighting of luminarias in the American Southwest and the traditional ritual of the Hanukkah Menorah.

The show also recounts the historical religious and cultural rituals practiced during the time of winter solstice - not only Christian and Jewish, but also Celtic, Nordic, Roman, Irish, Mexican and Hopi. It also takes a look at some of our more light-hearted seasonal traditions: from gift-giving and kissing under the mistletoe, to songs about lords a-leaping and ladies dancing, and the custom of decking the halls with greenery and candles. St. Nicholas, Sinterklaas, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, and Santa Claus all drop by as well.

### Distant Worlds: Alien Life?
Do you ever wonder if extraterrestrial life actually exists? Come enjoy a fulldome viewing of Distant Worlds - Alien Life. Not only does the film investigate the conditions required for life, beginning with the planets and moons in our Solar System, but it also ventures out to some of the newly-discovered exoplanets orbiting other stars. Potentially habitable exoplanets are being discovered regularly - worlds that are not only very far away, but also strange and unfamiliar. What could life on these worlds look like? What are the chances of encountering intelligent life in the future, and how might we detect it? Don't miss this unique opportunity to surpass the confines of Earth and delve into unfathomable cosmic spaces, all from the comfort of our planetarium.

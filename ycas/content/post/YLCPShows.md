### Sunstruck
Discover the wonders of our Sun. Its incredible energy has supported life on Earth for millennia, but is now threatening our technology and way of life.  Travel to the distant future to discover our Sun's connection to the universe's cosmic cycle of life and death in Sunstruck.

### Phantom of the Universe: The Hunt for Dark Matter
Phantom of the Universe is an exciting exploration of dark matter, from the Big Bang to its anticipated discovery at the Large Hadron Collider. The show reveals the first hints of its existence through the eyes of Fritz Zwicky, the scientist who coined the term "dark matter." It describes the astral choreography witnessed by Vera Rubin in the Andromeda galaxy and then plummets deep underground to see the most sensitive dark matter detector on Earth, housed in a former gold mine. From there, it journeys across space and time to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, speeding alongside particles before they collide in visually stunning explosions of light and sound, while learning how scientists around the world are collaborating to track down the constituents of dark matter.

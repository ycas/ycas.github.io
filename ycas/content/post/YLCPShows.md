### StarWatch
Learn how to find the planets and constellations that are visible in York's night sky. Become a star watcher by exploring the current night sky, locate visible planets and constellations, and enjoy some sky lore. Receive a star map and get answers to questions such as:<br>
* What can be seen with a telescope tonight?<br>
* How do I find the North Star?<br>
* Is there really a bear in the sky?<br>
* Why do stars have different colors?<br>
* What are the names of the brightest stars?<br>
* Why does Jupiter have different colored clouds?<br>

### One World, One Sky: Big Bird's Adventure!
In *One World, One Sky: Big Bird's Adventure!*, Elmo and Big Bird live in the United States and Hu Hu Zhu lives far away in China, but they discovered that they still see the same stars at night! The word for star in Chinese is "xing xing" (pronounced "sing sing"). How many "xing xing" do you see in this sky? When Elmo and Hu Hu Zhu "travel" to the moon, they discover some basic but surprising scientific facts. For example, they can't fly a kite there because there is no wind. The fuzzy friends then excitedly realize that children like to fly kites in both China and the United States!

### Max Goes to the Moon
In this children's planetarium program, Max (the dog) and a young girl named Tori take the first trip to the Moon since the Apollo era. Along the way, the story sets the stage for the topics including "Phases of the Moon," "Wings in Space?", and "Frisbees and Curve Balls on the Moon" - all thoughtfully explained so that grownups and children can learn together about science. Toward the end, Max and Tori's trip proves so inspiring to people back on Earth that all the nations of the world come together to build a great Moon colony from which "the beautiful views of Earth from the Moon made everyone realize that we all share a small and precious planet."

### The Sun: Our Living Star
The Sun has shone on our world for four and a half billion years. The light that warms our skin today has been felt by every person who has ever lived. It is our nearest star and our planet's powerhouse, the source of the energy that drives our winds, our weather and all life.

The passage of the Sun's fiery disc across the sky - day by day, month by month - was the only way to keep track of time for countless past civilizations. Don't be fooled by the terminology; although it is a typical dwarf star, the Sun consumes 600 million tons of hydrogen each second and is 500 times as massive as all the planets combined.

### A Part of the Sky Called Orion
A fantastic sky lore program covering the Greek, Egyptian, and Inupiaq cultures. We learn how each of these rich cultures viewed the same stars, but had different stories and images. Told in first-person in the context of the teller's life, we experience their ancient star lore and imagery. This show is best for 2nd grade and above, but even younger ones will enjoy the storytelling imagery and theme. This is storytelling at its best. A wonderful blend of imagery, music, and word; it's a treat for all.

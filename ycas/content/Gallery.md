YCAS member Adam Love provided this image of an emmission nebula in Cassiopeia.
![YCAS Logo](../img/AL/IC1805.png "Heart Nebula")
The picture of the Heart Nebula (IC1805) was taken between Dec 24 and Jan 25. Comprising six nights of imagining. Adam used the GTI71 with the ASI 2600MC Astrophotography Camera. Utilizing narrowband filters, Adam captured about 9.5 hours using the Askar D1 (HaOiii) filter and about 9.5 hours using the Asker D2 (S2Oiii) filter. The images were stacked and processed using Pixinsight using the Hubble SHO Pallet.

The Leo Triplet of galaxies consists of three galaxies, which lie at an average distance of 35 million light-years from Earth, below the belly of the constellation Leo the lion. NGC 3628 (top-left in the image) is viewed edge-on, while Messier 65 (bottom-right) and Messier 66 (top-right) are tilted towards the Earth. M65 &amp; 66 were discovered by Charles Messier on March 1, 1780; however, his telescope lacked the resolution to detect the dimmest of the trio, NGC 3628. Also known as the Hamburger Galaxy, NGC 3628 was not discovered until April 8, 1784, by William Herschel.

The image was captured from Wallingford-MAK Observatory on February 20, 2021. It consists of 125 2-minute exposures for a total integration time of just over four hours. The data was captured with SGP with pre and postprocessing performed in Pixinsight and Photoshop (watermark).

YCAS member Julie is new to astrophotography and has some excellent success with her SeeStar 50 telescope, stacking the (about) 4 hours of images with Siril software and using Starnet to separate the stars. Processed with Siril and Graxpert and combined in Photoshop Elements.

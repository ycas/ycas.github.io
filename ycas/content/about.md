## The York County Astronomical Society

The York Country Astronomical Society, Inc, is a non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of the science of astronomy.

The York County Astronomical Society was started in 1989, and currently has about 70 members in 4 counties in Pennsylvania as well as in Maryland and Delaware.

The Society also has special programs to showcase eclipses, meteor showers, comets, and other special events.

The Society operates the York Learning Center Planetarium bringing astronomy to the public, presenting astronomical shows and related astronomy programs of the night sky.

The Society hosts numerous groups for private star parties, from Boy and Girl Scout troops, church groups, school classes, and company groups. We also hold two ***Introduction to Astronomy*** classes each year.

The Society hosts the annual Mason-Dixon Star Party, a gathering of amateur and professional astronomers promoting the science of astronomy.

The Society owns 5 research-grade telescopes:

* An 18" Dobsonian
* A 14" Dobsonian and a 12" Computerized GoTo Telescope
* A 10" SCT Telescope 
* A 4.5" Newtonian Telescope
* A 4" Astro-Physics Refractor Telescope

The Society also owns a 12' dish antenna for radio astronomy, and associated electronic recording equipment, which will be developed and installed with the help of the York College of PA Engineering Department starting in the fall of this year!

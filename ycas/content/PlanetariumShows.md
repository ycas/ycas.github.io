<H4>New Telescope Clinic</H4>
Did you get a new telescope recently or discover an unused one in your attic?  Experience has shown that the first night out with a new telescope can be daunting as you try to perform all the initial setup work required.  Consequently, many new telescopes are used once or twice, then never again due to frustration.  To help get you started properly, the York County Astronomical Society is offering a New Telescope Clinic to help you set up your telescope the first time and learn how to use and enjoy it.
 
Bring your telescope and all the items that came with it (including batteries, if required, and the instruction manual).  We will check out your telescope, help you align the finder scope, show you how your telescope works, and help you with some initial observations of the sky (clear skies permitting).  Afterwards, take home a free Star Chart to help you continue your exploration of the nighttime sky.

When you look into the sky, the background not-quite-blackness is filled with the diffuse light of stars lost in the space between galaxies, these are the Cosmic Castaways.
When galaxies pass in the night they gravitationally twist and turn one another. Sometimes the interactions are nothing more than a cosmic side-swipe; two galaxies cross and both come out a little bit damaged. Sometimes the interactions merge and where once two shiny galaxies orbited now only once bursts with the light of a billion stars. No matter what happens, these events leave stellar orphans.
As the galaxies tear into one another, stars get gravitationally trapped in a tug-a-war between the two systems. Eventually, both galaxies will give up their pulling and let the stars drop. These stars are left abandoned in the space between the galaxies and scattered around the newly formed systems.

We explore the discoveries made possible by the use of technology - from the first telescope used by Galileo - to modern ones in use on Earth and in space. All have revealed the beauty of the cosmos. Come along for an exploration of nebulae, pulsars, and black holes! This program has a $32 surcharge.
 
**The Birth of the Solar System**
22 minutes<br>
Witness the dramatic collisions that shaped the planets and moons! How did our solar system originate? What chain of events led to its creation? Just as detectives look for traces of evidence to solve a mystery, astronomers analyze the evidence that points to the formation of the Sun and planets. In particular, they study the influence that impacts and collisions had on the worlds of the solar system. The most dramatic evidence for this collisional history of solar system evolution are the impact craters found on almost all the bodies in the solar system, including Earth. These surface scars tell us the formation history of planets, moons, and rings was violent. Yet today, we live in a relatively stable solar system, made possible by the shattering collisions that shaped our worlds. This program gives us a unique look at the formation of the solar system by tracing the role that collisions played throughout its history. Beginning with the condensation of the initial cloud of gas and cosmic dust, we explore the history of planetary formation and the mechanism of accretion that played an important role in shaping the worlds of the solar system.

**Chronicle of a Journey to Earth**
20 minutes<br>
Travel to a unique planet - to call your home! Imagine that you are a traveler from the depths of interstellar space. As you approach our solar system, what will you find? Long before you reach the Sun, you traverse the Oort cloud, the deep freeze at the outermost reaches. You pass by the gas giants and their families of moons and rings. Finally, you reach the inner solar system, and the rocky worlds of Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury. If you were looking for a place to call home, which world would YOU choose? From the cold frontier inhabited by the dwarf planets of the outer solar system to the warmth of the Sun, any self-respecting traveler would ultimately be drawn to Earth, to explore and understand how this planet alone has come to be an ideal haven for life. Discover seasonal climate changes, and witness wondrous visions from the surface of this unique world - Moon phases and eclipses. Come along for the ride, and see our neighborhood in space from a new perspective. This program has a $32 surcharge.
 
**Extrasolar Planets - discovering new worlds**
30 minutes<br>
We live on a small planet that revolves around a star that is no different in size, luminosity, or location, than any other. It is just one among many. Are the planets that orbit our star what distinguish it from the others? Are there also extrasolar planets that revolve around other stars? If that was the case, could it be that there are inhabitable worlds like Earth? The endless variety of the Solar System is barely a reflection of the infinite diversity of the Universe. But, until now, we only know of one planet where life has developed, ours! Astronomers on Earth study the movements of the stars, searching for planets in other suns. Using unique instruments, they observe thousands of stars at the same time; minute by minute, measuring the amount of light from each one of them with extreme precision, and detecting if one of them periodically changes brightness, even if the change is barely perceptible, by one part per ten thousand. Scientists who analyze the gathered data are able to tell if the star is a candidate for having at least one planet. Scientists hope one day to find life somewhere on one of the extrasolar planets, even if only in the form of microorganisms. This would be a historical discovery. Could one of these worlds be suitable for the development of life? The search for extrasolar planets focuses on the neighboring stars of our galaxy, the Milky Way, but this doesn't mean they are close to us. Our galaxy is enormous, so enormous that a ray of light takes more than one hundred thousand years to cross from one side to the other. However, if there is an extraterrestrial civilization in our galactic vicinity, they just may have noticed our presence because, without intending to, we have been transmitting signals for quite a long time.

**Moles: What Is Out There?**
37 minutes<br>
MOLES' story revolves around a young mole named Plato. Plato lives deep underground in a dark burrow full of mystery and surprises together with his mum and dad. He is a restless, curious and thoughtful creature. Plato is fascinated by the light that penetrates the entrance to his home. Sometimes it is lit; sometimes it is off. Why could that be? Our young friend is desperate to see what is out there in the outside world and one day he finally gets to see it all! Plato discovers day and night, the sun and the moon, and the stars! Plato's best friends are Alfa, Beta and Gamma with whom he loves to sing and go treasure hunting! Good thing that the professor Socrates keeps an eye on our young friends as sometimes things can get a little out of hand!

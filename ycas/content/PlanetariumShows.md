<p>The planetarium seats 60 people. Private programs are offered by reservation any day. School/Summer Camp groups can not schedule during school hours Monday through Friday to protects the school children from Covid.<p>

The cost of a 45 minute program is $40, an additional hour is $30 ($70 total). Payment for the program can be made at the door with cash, check (made out to YCAS) or credit/debit card.<p> 

The money raised from these programs goes towards the cost of using the planetarium and developing other astronomy programs for the community. Groups are encouraged to join together to fill the planetarium with other scouts or family members. Write to <a href="mailto:info@astroyork.com"><font color="#FFCC66">info@astroyork.com</font></a> for more information or to make a reservation.

<h5>The planetarium is closed May 25th to September 1st for summer school cleaning.</H5>

<H4>New Telescope Clinic</H4>
Did you get a new telescope recently or discover an unused one in your attic?  Experience has shown that the first night out with a new telescope can be daunting as you try to perform all the initial setup work required.  Consequently, many new telescopes are used once or twice, then never again due to frustration.  To help get you started properly, the York County Astronomical Society is offering a New Telescope Clinic to help you set up your telescope the first time and learn how to use and enjoy it.
 
Bring your telescope and all the items that came with it (including batteries, if required, and the instruction manual).  We will check out your telescope, help you align the finder scope, show you how your telescope works, and help you with some initial observations of the sky (clear skies permitting).  Afterwards, take home a free Star Chart to help you continue your exploration of the nighttime sky.

Sometimes the interactions are nothing more than a cosmic side-swipe; two galaxies cross and both come out a little bit damaged. Sometimes the interactions merge and where once two shiny galaxies orbited now only once bursts with the light of a billion stars. No matter what happens, these events leave stellar orphans. As the galaxies tear into one another, stars get gravitationally trapped in a tug-a-war between the two systems. Eventually, both galaxies will give up their pulling and let the stars drop.

		<p>Formed in 1989, the York County Astronomical Society, a 501( c )(3) non-profit organization, aims to promote interest, public education, and advancement of the science of astronomy.</p>
		<p>Have you attended one of our Public Events?<br>
        Astronomy Day?<br>The Lunar Eclipse?<br>
        Our Monthly Observing Sessions?<br>
		New Telescope Clinic?<br>
		Planetarium Shows?<br>
        <p>Did you have a good time?<br>
        Did you learn something new?</p>
        <p>If so, please consider a donation to YCAS.<br>
        Your financial donation will help us cover our basic operating expenses and help us do more public events in the future.</p>
        <p>We also accept telescope donations. We will make sure they are functional and either use them for our public sessions or donate them to local schools for use in their science classes. Telescopes that are too large to easily travel will be accepted on a case-by-case basis.

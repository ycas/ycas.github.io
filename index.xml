      <description>YCAS member Jim Smailing has taken some excellent pictures of the eclipsing Moon. These pictures were taken with the combination of a Motorola E5 plus cellphone, a Vankey cellphone telescope adapter mount, and an Orion ultrascopic 5mm eyepiece all attached to an Orion Skywatcher 120 f/8 acromatic refractor on an EG-3 equatorial mount with an Orion EQ-3M single axis drive. The first six photos were taken with a #15 yellow glass filter attached to the eyepiece.</description>

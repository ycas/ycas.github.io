      <description>YCAS member Lydell Nunn has taken some excellent pictures of deep sky objects.
The Leo Triplet of galaxies consists of three galaxies, which lie at an average distance of 35 million light-years from Earth, below the belly of the constellation Leo the lion. NGC 3628 (top-left in the image) is viewed edge-on, while Messier 65 (bottom-right) and Messier 66 (top-right) are tilted towards the Earth. M65 &amp;amp; 66 were discovered by Charles Messier on March 1, 1780; however, his telescope lacked the resolution to detect the dimmest of the trio, NGC 3628.</description>
